## Gradient Free Optimizer

In this research project, I am researching a gradient free optimizer that exploits multi-threads to search for the wegiths.

1. Using Monte Carlo with multiple threads to estimate the weights 
2. Comparing with tradition Gradient Descent algorithm

**Configuration**

Number of Monte Carlo iteration (for each thread): 1000
Number of thread: 10
Gradient descent iteration: 10000
Number of trail (number of generated data set): 100
Number of observations (number of row for the generated data): 1000
